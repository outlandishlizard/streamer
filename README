CS 552 A1 Homework 2: Text/Video Server
-------------
Group Members: 
Danny Cooper (serverside datastructures, synchronization, video functionality),
George Silvis III (monitor/kernel module),
Andrew Mohn (netcode/client code)
-------------
Build Instructions:
make frame_test
modify global_config.h as you desire to enable/disable different functionalities (comments in file)
-------------
Run Instructions:
./frame_test to start server
python client.py localhost 8080 <videoname>
(use client_text.py without the final argument for text clients)
-------------
Notes:
The video server can serve folders full of jpegs with the naming convention frame-<number>.jpeg

PS: For more part III documentation, see monitor.c, module/mythread.c,
mythread.c, and associated header files.  Don't try to just compile and insmod
the module---it probably won't work.  That's because the syscall number and
location of the syscall_table symbol are hardcoded in syscall_config.h .  It
has instructions for determining the right value.
